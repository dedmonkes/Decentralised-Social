# Align Governance

## Overview
Align governance is a social graph based DAO governance program. It uses the social graph to form relationships between the members, proposers and other DAO communities.


# Voting Structure

Voting is participated in using nft’s & identifiers. Nft’s gate the access to DAO participation but Identifiers describe hierarchy and voting weight. The weighting of votes can be attributed by the reputation (earnt by full-filling services + feedback) and/or participation (voting on proposals) of the identifier.

The options for voting are used to rank the proposals for the ending round, the most positively weighted proposal will be rank 1, second, rank 2 etc.

There are two voting options one being up and one being down, these are similar to yes/no voting options of traditional DAO structures

## Service Market

Reputation for proposal completion is useful for scouting the right talent to deliver on the proposal. In the future we will provide access to categorised profiles both global and community based that DAO’s can use to hire to execute their strategy.

## Hierarchy

A DAO needs leaders otherwise the process is born into chaos with no direction. A council should be appointed by the community for each subsector of the Dao. Putting a select few in charge of choosing the final proposals that are presented, hiring who is needed if not in the proposal. 

This process should be transparent and subdaos formed by categorised proposals and sub council's based on classification of departments.

The Sub Sector DAO’s council should be elected by the community and their position is held for 4 months before another election is held. A minimum reputation level needs to be accrued for you to be considered for election, this should be weighted based on mean (or median?) reputation levels in the community.
